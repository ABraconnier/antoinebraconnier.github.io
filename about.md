title: About me
---

I'm a Ruby on Rails backend developer based in Paris, France.

I'm currently working at [Wecasa](https://www.wecasa.fr), as a lead dev for the
payment team.

I am passionate about languages (human and computer).

I also code for fun with [pico-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO-8).

## Where I come from

I have a litterature and linguistic background in romance languages (French, Spanish, and even Latin!). I used to be specialized in the Middle Ages / Renaissance era, most specifically the Old and Middle French language and litterature. Deciphering old manuscripts and studying the language of the time was a passion of mine. I lived in Spain and south of France and after a few years in the academic world starting a PhD, I realized I needed to find a new career path, because the academic world was not really for me and I needed to find a new meaning in my everyday life.

I did a carreer shift in 2019 and learned Ruby / Ruby On Rails and quickly found a job in Brussels, Belgium where I was working in [Abbove](https://www.abbove.com/fr) as a fullstack dev and where I had the chance to even start learning Vue.js. I moved to Paris in 2022 and started to work at [Wecasa](https://www.wecasa.fr/) as a backend ruby on rails developer.

## What I do now

I'm currently working at [Wecasa](https://www.wecasa.fr/), as a lead dev for the payment team. My day to day life is mostly focused on building projects in collaboration with the Product team, the stakeholders and the other developers. I want to build resilient and scalable products that are easy to maintain and that can be easily extended: the simpler, the better! I find joy in collaboration with all my workmates.

Of course, I still love to learn new things: I have a creative side and I love to experiment with new technologies, like pico-8. I'm also still passionate about culture, history, language and humans in general.
